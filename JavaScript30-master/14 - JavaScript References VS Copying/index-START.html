      // Let's say we have an array

      console.log(players, team);

      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      // team[3] = "Joe";
      console.log(players, team);

      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too! (unlike the above with strings and numbers etc.)

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      // one way
      const team2 = players.slice();
      team2[3] = "joe";
      console.log(team2, players);

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const team3 = [].concat(players);

      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const team4 = [...players];
      team4[3] = "Howdy";
      console.log(team4, players);

      // also
      const team5 = Array.from(players);
      team5[3] = "Awesome";
      console.log(team5, players);

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80
      };

      // and think we make a copy:  but we can't update the copy without also updating the original object this way.
      const admiral = person;
      // admiral.number = 99;
      console.log(admiral, person);

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const adm2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 50 });
      console.log(adm2, person);

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread.  Is this yet in javascript?

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

      console.log(dev, jonathan);
      dev.name = "joecool";
      // this will update the first level item such as name on the copy, but not the social items more than one level deep.

      //  look in to ways to deep clone instead.
      // Also the poor mans deep clone is below, may cause performance issues:
      const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(jonathan));
      console.log(dev2);
